1)What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

Gitignore is a file that includes a list of files or directories that should be ignored when committing to remote repositories. 
For a Java Project it includes, .mtj.tmp/, *.class, *.jar, *.war, *.ear, *.nar, hs_err_pid* etc.


2)What does fast-forward in Git mean?

A fast-forward is what Git does when you merge or rebase against a branch that is simply ahead 
of the one you have checked-out. 

3)Why should you have different branches?

Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate
their work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on. A Git branch is essentially 
an independent line of development. 
You can take advantage of branching when working on new features or bug fixes 
because it isolates your work from that of the other team members.


4)In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?

Depending on the scale of the project you can add as many git repositories. Having a single 
repository for one project could lead to evolution of unidentified bugs and tracking the history of a 
feature may become more difficult. So, it is better to have more repositories for different team 
members and different functionality.
